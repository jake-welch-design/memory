    <h1>happy html day 2025</h1>
    <p>August 2, 2025 at Louis Valentino Jr. Park in Red Hook, Brooklyn, New York City, Kings County, New York State, in
        the United States of America on Planet Earth. I saw some of my friends from Creative Coding NYC, Shiva, Marcos,
        and Sai. Some folks I met that I didn't know (who I can remember!) were Frank, Susan, Josh, and Sequoia. Someone
        was writing html tags on green tape and handing them out. Another printing html tags onto receipts (I got
        &lt;html&gt; and &lt;button&gt;). Some people
        brought interactive diy games, frisbees, someone started an exquisite corpse html page on a notepaper. I was
        actually suprised at the amount of people writing html on paper (or even a watermelon). There were discussions
        on the use and purpose of some obscure tags, another about coding being a form of magic and divining, some folks
        exchanged numbers or, of course, website urls. The vibes were immaculate, the entire evening was imbued with
        HTML ENERGY.</p>
