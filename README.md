# Three.js Window Resize Example

This is a minimal three.js project that fills the window and resizes automatically.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in your browser. No build step is required.

- The scene will always fill the window.
- Resizing the window will update the renderer and camera aspect ratio.

## Dependencies

- [three.js](https://threejs.org/) (loaded via CDN)

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – Loads three.js and your script
- `main.js` – Sets up the scene, camera, renderer, and resize handler
